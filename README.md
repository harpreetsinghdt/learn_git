git status --short
```

## Adding File To Staging Area

git add --a
```

```
git commit -m "First Commit"

## Git Clone from remote

> Cloning / making local copy of repository from github with same name as on github

```
git clone https://github.com/harpreetsinghdt/javascript-code.git
```

> Cloning/ making local copy of repository from github with new name as mentioned after repository url

```
git clone https://github.com/harpreetsinghdt/javascript-code.git jscode
```

## Git Add Remote Repo

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/harpreetsinghdt/codehome.git
```

```
git branch -M main
```

```
git push -u origin main
```

> Check remote directory name

```
git remote
```

> Tells pull & push origin (url)

```
git remote -v
```

## Alias for commands

```
git config --global alias.st status
git st
```

```
git config --global alias.ci commit
git ci
```

```
git config --global alias.unstage 'restore --staged --'
git unstage filename.txt
```

```
git config --global alias.last 'log -p -1'
git last
```

## Git Branches & Merge

> Check all existing branches

```
git branch
```

> Show branches with last commit hash & message

```
git branch -v
```

> Show all branches which are already merged, could be deleted

```
git branch --merged
```

> Show all branches which are not merged yet, shouldn't be deleted

```
git branch --no-merged
```

> To delete a branch, it will give error if branch (develop) is not merged, to force delete use -D

```
git branch -d develop
```

```
git branch --delete <branchname>
```

> Merge branch develop to msater

```
git merge develop
```

> Merge abort branch

```
git merge --abort
```

> Add new branch if not exists and shift to that new branch

```
git checkout -b develop
```

> Shift to another branch

```
git checkout -b develop
```

> To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream

```
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

> To push a local branch to remote branch

```
git push origin develop
```

> Delete a remote branch

```
git remote rm origin
```

> The upstream branch of your current branch does not match
> the name of your current branch. To push to the upstream branch
> on the remote, use

```
git push origin HEAD:main
```

> To push to the branch of the same name on the remote, use

```
git push origin HEAD
```

> To choose either option permanently, see push.default in 'git help config'.

> To avoid automatically configuring upstream branches when their name doesn't match the local branch, see option 'simple' of branch.autoSetupMerge in 'git help config'.

> Git refusing to merge unrelated histories on rebase

```
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

## Remove the files from git's index

> If you committed node_modules before they were added to the gitignore file, git is going to notice changes each time you add and install a new package, when the node_modules directory changes. So we need one more step to seal the deal.

```
git rm -r --cached node_modules
```

> Now we need to commit our changes. This commit will include our .gitignore addition from the previous step.

```
git commit -m "Remove and ignore node_modules"
```
